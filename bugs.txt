If a course is about to begin, a tutor is able to modify the course's timestamp to an already passed time.
This essentially makes the course disappear without warning. 
Disable this "feature".

Since in the firestore courses collection the tutor is saved as a map and not a reference to the tutor's document, 
the tutor's color change is not reflected on already created courses.
Disable this "feature".
